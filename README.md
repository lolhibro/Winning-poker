# Winning-poker
Created an algorithm that returns the probability of winning a poker game with an input hand. Fully deterministic, doesn't make use of Monte Carlo methods as almost all such online calculators do.

Note: this project is still INCOMPLETE. Working on fixing the probability calculator for Full House.
